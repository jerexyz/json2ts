1. Copy sample JSON from [http://json.org/example.html](http://json.org/example.html)
2. Paste into [http://json2ts.com/](http://json2ts.com/) by @Sorskoot to generate TypeScript interfaces 
3. Add TS file to application working folder 
4. Enjoy autocomplete with Visual Studio Code!  ![image](http://spjeff.com/img/shades_smile.gif)
